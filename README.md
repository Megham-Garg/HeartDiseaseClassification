Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning
This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease classification.

It is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning proof of concept might look like.

What is classification?
Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (single-class classification). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as multi-class classification.

What we'll end up with
Since we already have a dataset, we'll approach the problem with the following machine learning modelling framework.
